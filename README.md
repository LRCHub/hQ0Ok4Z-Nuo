[00:02.30] Yeah
[00:03.04] (Show the world)
[00:11.04] 
[00:04.22] Two sides to a story, but they never tell my side
[00:07.67] Never been the kinda guy to stay inside the guidelines
[00:10.71] I know I'm the bad guy, I don't gotta ask why
[00:13.43] If you try to step to me, it'll be the last time
[00:37.43] 
[00:16.32] I got dirt on my name, six feet in the ground
[00:19.33] I got people in my past try bringin' me down
[00:22.01] Say I'm losin' my mind, I-I don't wanna be found
[00:25.04] Grew up in the shadow, but I know they watchin' me now (oh-oh-oh)
[00:57.54] 
[00:27.68] Paranoia, on-the-go, I'm moving silent (let's go)
[00:31.01] Pull up on ya, I got trouble right behind me (let's go)
[00:33.78] Bite the bullet, suit and tie, the silver linin' (uh-huh)
[00:36.28] I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'ma show you how to crash a party
[01:01.28] 
[00:38.75] Every time you pop off, they hopin' that you fall hard
[00:42.64] They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
[00:45.29] Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
[00:48.34] They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
[01:08.34] 
[00:50.61] Ooh, they love it when you lost, boy
[00:54.19] Now the low life at the top floor
[00:56.45] Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
[00:59.82] They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
[01:19.82] 
[01:02.22] They talk about me, I forget to listen (listen)
[01:05.14] At least I get the recognition (recognition)
[01:07.89] Heavyweight, I pull up on you with the repetition
[01:10.54] You in the pit, it's not no exhibition
[01:29.54] 
[01:12.99] Oh, they big mad, I'm the big boss
[01:15.75] Talk a big game, take a big loss
[01:18.45] Growin' up, I was the problem that they didn't solve
[01:21.59] I'm the piece that wouldn't fit inside the jigsaw
[01:46.09] 
[01:24.19] I got a lotta punch lines and a quick jab
[01:26.85] I'm runnin' straight through, I don't gotta zigzag
[01:29.74] I got a heavy heart, it's hard to lift that
[01:32.61] From the cradle to the grave, never changed, make 'em dig that
[02:03.61] 
[01:35.83] Paranoia, on-the-go, I'm moving silent (let's go)
[01:38.67] Pull up on ya, I got trouble right behind me (let's go)
[01:41.45] Bite the bullet, suit and tie, the silver linin' (uh-huh)
[01:44.05] I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'ma show you how to crash a party
[02:09.05] 
[01:46.70] Every time you pop off, they hopin' that you fall hard
[01:50.56] They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
[01:52.90] Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
[01:56.39] They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
[02:16.39] 
[01:58.46] Ooh, they love it when you lost, boy
[02:01.98] Now the low life at the top floor
[02:04.17] Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
[02:07.42] They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
[02:27.42] 
[02:12.62] Wanna kiss me long good night with a rose
[02:16.07] Hoping that the Eiffel falls, of course
[02:19.06] You don't understand the life we chose
[02:21.64] (On life support, life goes)
[02:35.64] 
[02:23.36] I need my silence, my privacy, so I can heal
[02:26.51] And even rockstars got feelings that they feel
[02:29.46] In reality, this just repeats like a drill
[02:32.28] Always, oh-oh, oh-oh
[02:42.28] 
[02:39.96] Every time you pop off, they hopin' that you fall hard (oh)
[02:44.25] They prayin' for the death of a rockstar (yeah, yeah)
[02:46.53] Everybody hatin' ever since you got more
[02:49.64] They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
[03:09.64] 
[02:52.20] Ooh, they love it when you lost, boy (you lost)
[02:55.58] Now the low life at the top floor (top floor)
[02:57.74] Everybody hatin' ever since you got more (ever since you got more)
[03:01.19] They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
[03:21.19] 
[03:03.43] Pop off (yeah), they hopin' that you fall hard (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[03:06.78] They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
[03:09.11] Everybody hatin' ever since you got more (ever since you got more)
[03:12.36] They prayin' for the death of a rockstar
